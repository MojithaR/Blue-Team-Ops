# 🛡️ Foundations of Operationalizing MITRE ATT&CK v13 - Introduction  

Welcome to the foundational guide on operationalizing **MITRE ATT&CK v13**! 🎯  

This document walks you through **Threat-Informed Defense**, using key elements like:  
✅ **Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysis (CTIA)**  
✅ **Defensive Engagement Process**  
✅ **Collaboration and Sharing**  

📌 **The Goal?** Improve how organizations **Prevent**, **Detect**, and **Respond** to cyber threats by leveraging **real-world attack data, Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tools, and industry collaboration.**

## 🛠 **Step 1: Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysis (CTIA)**  

🎯 **Purpose:** Analyzes attack tactics, malware hashes, and suspicious domains to predict cyber threats.  

### **📝 Inputs & Outputs**  
| **Inputs**                           | **CTIA Processing**        | **Outputs**                               |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 🔹 **Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs)**  | 🔍 Threat Pattern Analysis | 🚫 Prevent: Pending / Active / Successful |
| 🔹 **Malware Hashes**               | 🔄 Identify Behaviors      | 🛑 Detect: Pending / Active / Successful |
| 🔹 **Suspicious Domains**           | ⚡ Threat Intelligence Correlation | ⚡ Respond: Pending / Active / Successful |

📌 **Real-World Example:** If a security team identifies a **new malware variant**, they analyze its behavior (hash, network communication) to **predict and block future attacks**.

## 🔥 **Step 2: Defensive Engagement Process**  

🎯 **Purpose:** Uses **Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)** tools to test security defenses against real attack scenarios.  

📌 **How It Works:**  
- The **BAS tool** uses behaviors identified in **CTIA** to simulate attacks in an organization's environment.  
- Results show whether the **Prevent, Detect, and Respond** actions worked effectively.  
- If issues are found, updates are made, and the process repeats.

📌 **Real-World Example:** A **financial organization** simulates a **ransomware attack** to test whether **its endpoint security can detect and stop it in time**.

## 🔄 **Step 3: Continuous Improvement (Collaboration & Sharing)**  

🎯 **Purpose:** Shares real-world cyber threat data with global organizations using standard formats like **STIX** and **TAXII**.  

### **🔗 Key Collaboration Platforms & Resources**
