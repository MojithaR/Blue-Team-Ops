## 🔑 FortiSIEM Dashboard Overview
### **Bitwarden Password Manager** 🔐
- Used to store and retrieve credentials for FortiSIEM login.

### **Dashboard Elements** 📈
- **EPS (Events Per Second) Graph**
  - Normal range: **12K - 16K** ✅
  - Below **12K** or above **16K** is **suspicious** ⚠️
- **Reporting Device List** 📋
  - Expected devices frequently appear.
  - Unusual devices = **Investigate** 🚨
- **Investigating Suspicious EPS Peaks** 🔍
  - Check **Reporting Device IPs**.
  - Conduct further investigation based on **IP address**.

---

## 🗂 CMDB (Configuration Management Database)
- **Stores:** Users, devices, rules, use cases.
- **Device Statuses:**
  - ✅ **Approved** – Communication is validated.
  - ⏳ **Pending** – Connection approved, waiting for logs.
  - ❌ **Decommissioned** – Theoretically not sending logs, but needs verification.

#### 📌 Investigating Decommissioned Devices
- **Performance Logs vs. True Logs**
  - **Performance Logs:**
    - System events like **CPU usage, memory usage, uptime.**
    - Belong to **Event Categories 3 & 6**.
  - **True Logs:**
    - Active network traffic logs.
- **Investigation Focus:**
  - Primarily on **approved devices**.
  - If an anomaly is detected in **pending or decommissioned devices**, they require analysis.
